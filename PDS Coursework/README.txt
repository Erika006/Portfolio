This coursework was done using the 2009 ASA Statistical COmputing and Graphics Data Expo database which consisted of flight arrival and departure details for all commercial flights on major carriers with USA. Time period of this database is from October 1987 to April 2008. This database is provided by the Harvard Dataverse. 

The requirements of this project was to answer 5 questions given in the Instructions folder by extracting and manipulating this database. I also had to create my own visuals for easier referencing.
